>   ##                              ✨🎉🚀 **making learning fun again**  🚀🎉✨


to cap the semester i took a Study Skills course, i made this application only to find out that I made something actually useful and will need it in my studies ever since.

i was scrolling through the internet when i came upon a reel about Japanese textbook with a red filter when placed on the page conceals the answers and when removed the answers show. That is the physics of light and how red filters absord red light and hence you nolonger see the red ink beneath it. But i was struck by the application of that principle in that context and furthermore how philosophically the answer (knowledge) is always on the page but only through certain lens can it be finally perceived.

i then thought to create an app that, just like camera filters emphasize certain colors and bring out certain vibes from one picture, the same is applicable to textbook text, how it can be consumed in more than just reading it but also through transforming it, manipulating it, mining it and applying certain study skills filters to it.

StudyGenius is a premium, AI-powered study assistant designed to transform raw study material into interactive, cognitively optimized learning experiences.

It uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash to analyze text or uploaded PDFs and applies specific "Cognitive Filters" to help you learn better, faster, and with more engagement.

🏗️ Technical Stack  
Backend: Python (Flask)  
AI Engine: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API  
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), Vanilla JavaScript  
Design: Dynamic "Chic" UI with color-shifting themes and SVG iconography  

🎨 The 6 Cognitive Filters  
The app is built around six distinct modes, each represented by a color:

📘 Blue Filter (Metacognition)  
Goal: Deep Understanding.  
Action: Breaks down text using Bloom's Taxonomy. It identifies key concepts and generates questions that test you at different cognitive levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).

💛 Yellow Filter (Memory Mastery)  
Goal: Active Recall.  
Action: Automatically creates fill-in-the-blank exercises from your notes. It has different difficulty modes (e.g., "Hint Mode" showing the first letter, or "Hard Mode" for full blanks) to test your memory retention.

💚 Green Filter (Cognitive Load)  
Goal: Simplification.  
Action: Takes complex, dense technical text and "chunks" it into small, manageable pieces. It identifies prerequisites you need to know and rewrites difficult sections to be beginner-friendly.

⚫ Grey Filter (Time Blocking)  
Goal: Deep Focus.  
Action: Structures your study time into locked focus sessions (like Pomodoro). To "unlock" the next break or session, you must answer an AI-generated question about the material you just studied.

💜 Purple Filter (Research Helper)  
Goal: Expansion.  
Action: Analyze your notes to find gaps in your knowledge. It generates a 4-phase research plan, suggests specific Google/YouTube search queries, and recommends related topics to explore.

🧡 Orange Filter (Boredom Buster)  
Goal: Engagement.  
Action: Makes studying fun! It rewrites dry text into Gen Z slang or "silly mode," generates jokes and puns about the topic, adds sarcastic commentary, and creates fun facts to keep you awake.

✨ Key Features  
Premium "Chic" UI: A glassmorphism-based design that changes its entire color theme (gradients, buttons, accents) to match the active filter.  
PDF & Text Support: You can drag and drop PDF textbooks or paste raw notes directly into any filter.  
Dashboard: A minimal, professional hub to launch your learning sessions.  

It is essentially a "Swiss Army Knife" for students, using AI to handle the mental heavy lifting of organizing and gamifying study sessions.
